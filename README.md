# PDF to MDX Converter With PDF VIEWER, MDX Viewer and MDX Editor. 

This project is a web application designed to convert PDF files into MDX (Markdown with JSX) format. Users can upload a PDF, view its content, convert it to MDX, edit the MDX content, and preview the result.

While the project is functional, there are areas that need improvement, and the conversion process isn't perfect yet.
